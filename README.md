# Flask Bad To-do List
# What is it exactly ?

This is a simple to-do app made with Python and HTML/CSS. I wanted to make this because it allowed me to learn both the basics of a web microframework (Flask) and HTML/CSS for the first time. You can basically add, remove and change status (with "completed" and "not completed". 

# Setup

- You can install all necessary librairies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` on your terminal.
- To launch the application, set the location of the app (ex:`Set-Location -Path "C:/Users/X/Documents/flask-bad-todo-list"` on Powershell) and run the command `python main.py`.
